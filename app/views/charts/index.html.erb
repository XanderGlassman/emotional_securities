		<h1>ABOUT</h1>
		<article>
		<p><strong>Emotional Securities</strong> is an experimental analysis of general sentiment towards a given company against the stock price of said company.</p>
		<p>Working off a few of the core metrics of behavioral finance, we pulled "herd" sentiment data from the <a href = "https://dev.twitter.com/">Twitter Streaming API</a>, and "expert" sentiment from articles on <a href = "http://finance.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Finance</a>. <a href = "http://www.alchemyapi.com/">AlchemyAPI</a> kindly granted us academic access to <a href = "http://www.alchemyapi.com/products/products-overview/">their amazing service</a>, which we used to analyze sentiment in tweets, and entity targeted sentiment in articles.</p>
		<p>We have incorporated a <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier">Na√Øve Bayes</a> <a href = "https://github.com/bmuller/ankusa">implimentation</a> to sort out irrelevant tweets; our algorithm, fondly nicknamed Hal9000, is given a sampling of "expert" tweets, and non-related tweets. It learns what words and phrases are commonly used in the relevant tweets, and sorts our incoming stream based on that data.</p>
		<p>The graph in the main view plots, in line form, stock price over time and an exponential moving average of tweet sentiments, which can be seen in a scatterplot behind the two main lines.</p>
